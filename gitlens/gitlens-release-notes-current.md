## ‚ú®GitLens+ Features for All on Local & Public Repos

With GitLens 13.0, we are excited to bring the power of GitLens+ features like the Commit Graph, Visual File History, and Worktrees to ALL  users on local and public repos. No account required. 

Here‚Äôs how to get started with each of the GitLens+ features with your local or public repos:

- [Commit Graph](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/gitlens-plus/#commit-graph)
- [Worktrees](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/gitlens-plus/#visual-file-history)
- [Visual File History](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/gitlens-plus/#visual-file-history)

## ‚ú®Commit Graph  - Now out of Preview!

We‚Äôre delighted to announce that the Commit Graph is out of Preview, and is full featured! This means you may now interact with the Commit Graph directly and take actions like:

- Interact with branches, commits, tags and more with right-click context menus
- Double click a branch to checkout a branch
- Search and filter for commits
- Get information about Pull Requests

### Full context menu support

Interact with your branches, commits, and more! Context menus are now available when you right click on any branch, tag, commit, or author in the Commit Graph. You may even interact with the Commit Graph column headers to the author, date or SHA columns. So much power! 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/Commit-Search-Context-Menus.gif" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Context menu actions include but are not limited to:

- Switch to Branch
- Revert Commit
- Switch to Commit
- Create Branch
- Merge
- Rebase
- Create Worktree
- Create Pull Request

### Rich commit search

Find exactly what you are looking for with the rich search on the powerful new Commit Graph. 

Whether searching for a specific commit, message, author, a changed file or files, or even a specific code change, the Commit Graph will highlight matching results across your entire repository. Use shortcut keys or the up/down arrows on the search bar  to navigate the search results; `F3` (also `Cmd+G` on macOS) goes to the next result from your selection while  `Shift+F3`  ( also `Shift+Cmd+G` on macOS) goes to the previous. Additionally you can quickly jump to the first or  last result, by holding `Shift` while clicking on the up/down arrows respectively ‚Äì to make it easy to see when a file or change was introduced into the codebase.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/Rich-Commit-Search.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Once you type search filtering criteria, use the arrow icons to move through each result.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/Commit-Search-Moving-Arrow-Keys.gif" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

### PR information in form of icon

Wait, which branch has that PR? 

If connected to one of the rich integrations with GitHub or GitLab, the Commit Graph will display a PR icon for any branch currently in PR. Right-click on the PR icon to open the PR on the GitHub or GitLab, or copy the URL.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/PR-Icon.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

### Hiding remotes, branches or tags

Need to focus and have too many remotes or just want to curate how much is shown in your Commit Graph? Now you can hide entire remotes, or specific branches and tags. Hover over any  branch or tag to access the ‚ÄúHide‚Äù button  or right-click to hide the whole remote, or just the local or remote branch, to help focus your Commit Graph.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/Branch-Hide.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

### All new home view

It‚Äôs a homecoming! Our GitLens home view has a new look, with quick links to our Getting Started guides, Integrations, Trial info, and Feature spotlights. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/GitLens-Home.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

### List or tree view in Commit Details View

The Commit Details View, which gives you contextual change info about your code, got a new toggle for List and Tree view.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/view-as-list.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

To open the Commit Details view, open the command palette using <kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd> and type: Show Commit Details view or navigate to the Commit Details view in the Side Bar.

</div>

## ‚ú®Commit Graph  - Preview 

Users may now view the Commit Graph of their repository through GitLens. 

This beloved feature from GitKraken Client helps visualize your repo commit history and give you information about branches, commits, and collaborators all in one view ‚Äî making it easier to see contributions and help you make faster, more informed decisions.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/1-commit-graph.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

To open the Commit Graph, open the command palette using the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>P</kbd> and type `Show Commit Graph`.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2-commit-graph.gif" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

This will open a new tab and render your current repo‚Äôs commit history, where you may scroll through your history and resize any of the columns widths. 

You may also access the Commit Graph by clicking this graph icon from the Source Control view in the Sidebar or Status Bar.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/How-to-open-commit-graph-B.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

The Commit Graph is available to all users working on public repositories, and requires no account. Additionally, users with a paid GitLens+ subscription can use the Commit Graph with private repos. 

For those on [vscode.dev](vscode.dev) or [github.dev](github.dev), this also means you can open the Commit Graph on a web browser. 

The Commit Graph is in `Preview` mode, and we‚Äôd love to hear your feedback in the [Commit Graph discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/discussions/2158).



## Commit Details View

GitLens 12.2 also ships with a `Commit Details View`, which gives you contextual change info about your code.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/3-commit-details-view.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

To open the `Commit Details View`, open the command palette using <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>P</kbd> and this time type: `Show Commit Details View` or navigate to the Commit Details View in the Sidebar.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/4-commit-details-view.gif" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

The `Commit Details View` updates as you move your cursor throughout the file with information about the commit that modified that line of code. Get quick information about the commit author, commit ID, links to Pull Requests, files modified in the commit, and more.

Click on a file to open the diff, and see what changed. You may also hover over the file name to access options like Open File, Open Changes with Working File, and Open Remote.


## ‚ú® GitHub Enterprise Integration

Next, GitLens+ now offers a richer integration with GitHub Enterprise.

Once authenticated, GitLens will enrich GitHub autolinks in the hovers. You‚Äôll see your GitHub Enterprise avatar, links to related pull requests, along with a footnote of the pull request or issue details. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/6-GitHub-Enterprise.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

You‚Äôll see similar details from the Sidebar views for any commit or branch associated with a pull  request or issue.

## ‚ú® Single Sign On


Single Sign On is here, providing GitLens+ users with a more secure sign in method! 


### Requirements and configuration

Your GitKraken account may now initiate an Oauth authentication flow with the following supported Identity Providers (IdPs):

- Azure Active Directory
- Okta
- Google Identity Platform
- Ping Identity


<img src="/wp-content/uploads/SSO-setup.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Please note that your IdP will first need to be configured before setting up the connection in your GitKraken account. For assistance, please contact your IdP administrator or consult the IdP documentation for help. 

Additional requirements:
    - Configurable only by GitKraken Owner or Admin of an organization
    - Subscribed to either the Teams or Enterprise plan

‚Üí [Documentation: How to set up SSO in GitKraken](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/single-sign-on/)

### Signing in with SSO

GitLens+ users should see a new option to Sign in with SSO from the login screen.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/9-GitLens-SSO.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

After clicking `Sign in with SSO`, the SSO form will open and ask for an email address to use for SSO login. The app will then check the email and determine whether the email address belongs to a single IdP for SSO. When the email address is successfully identified, the user will be taken to that IdP to login.

Once authenticated, the user may use GitLens+


## More improvements

### Stash naming defaults

When applying or popping a stash, GitLens will default the commit message input to the stash message. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/10-stash-commit-message.gif" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

And when stashing changes, the stash name will now default to any entry in the commit message input.

### Stats in comparisons

There are now stats about additions & deletions in files nodes in comparisons. To get these stats, navigate to the `Search & Compare` view in the Sidebar and create a comparison between commits.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/11-comparison-stats.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

### Search for text in Interactive Rebase Editor

And users may now search for text on the `Interactive Rebase Editor` using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>F</kbd>.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/12-interactive-rebase-text-search.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">
